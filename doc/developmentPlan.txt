Development Tasks
=================

To Do
-----
- define a new global symbol t which stands for true and evaluates to itself.
- make nil the exclusive value for false.
- make all primitives use t and nil as the boolean values instead of 0 and nil.
- make evaluations of undefined variables raise LypsRuntimeError instead of
  evaluating to themselves.
- promote the block primitive to let and let*.
- remove def!, def!! and set!.
- continue to bring other primitives into alignment with common lisp.
- implement stream IO primitives.
- implement lisp structs.
- implement packages.  A package x is a symbol in the global namespace which
  refers to another Environment instance which contains all the symbols of
  a package (lisp source file).  For any symbol y in the package p, this
  can be accessed with the notation p::y.
- Produce more test files including error testing.

Completed
---------
2025.11.25
- Update the lisp scanner to accept strings that include python style escape
  sequences.
