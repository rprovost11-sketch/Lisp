Development Tasks
=================

To Do
-----
- rewrite LispInterpreter._lbindArguments() to conform as much as possible to
  the common lisp standard document section 5.2.2. Lambda-Expressions.
- implement stream IO primitives.
- implement lisp structs.
- implement packages.  A package x is a symbol in the global namespace which
  refers to another Environment instance which contains all the symbols of
  a package (lisp source file).  For any symbol y in the package p, this
  can be accessed with the notation p::y.
- Produce more test files including error testing and listener command testing.
- Figure out how to make an environment scope that is parent to the GLOBAL
  Environment in which the built-ins are defined.  They cannot be redefined,
  only temporarily covered up by a descendent environment.
- Can we make the nil list immutable by subclassing LList, overriding all the
  methods to make __len__() return 0 and make anything that normally mutates
  the list raise an exception then perhaps the nil list would truly be
  immutable.
- Consider adding a semantic analyzer between parsing and evaluation which
  can scan the AST for errors such as the wrong number of arguments to a
  primitive.  This would eliminate a lot of the runtime error checking and
  speed up evaluation.

Completed
---------
2025.11.25
- Update the lisp scanner to accept strings that include python style escape
  sequences.
- define a new global symbol t which stands for true and evaluates to itself.
- make all primitives use t and nil as the boolean values instead of 0 and nil.
- make nil the exclusive value for false.
- remove set!.  Fully replace with setf.
- implement let and let*.
- remove block primitive.
- remove def!, def!!.

2025.11.26
- The predicates have all been updated to lisp predicate names.  The old names
  which were of a more consistent naming pattern are aliased in library.lisp
  so that the ? names can still be used instead of the lisp names.
- bring the relational operations into alignment with common lisp.
- bring the arithmetic operations into alignment with common lisp.
- continue to bring other primitives into alignment with common lisp.

2025.12.15
- Comleted encapsulation of the common lisp interpreter into the LispInterpreter
  class.  It's now possible, if I choose, to implement a SchemeInterpreter
  class that reuses all of the remaining code.

2026.01.12
- make evaluations of undefined variables raise LispRuntimeError instead of
  evaluating to themselves.
